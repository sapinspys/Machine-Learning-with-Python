## Introduction

### What is machine learning?

While working at IBM, **Arthur Samuel** originally coined the term **machine learning** in 1959 and defined it as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to **LEARN** without being explicitly programmed."

A more technical definition was later formed by **Tom Mitchell**, who proposed in 1998 that machine learning algorithms "**LEARN** from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

The SAS Institue, a modern leader in the field, defines machine learning as a "**method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.** It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can **LEARN** from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention."

According to my understanding, machine learning is a capability programmed into computers that allows the it to **LEARN** just like the human mind does. And like a well-oiled statician, the machine learning algorithm applies tested statistical learning techniques to identify valuable patterns in data.
