## Introduction

**What is machine learning?**

The term **machine learning** was coined by **Arthur Samuel** in 1959 while working with IBM:

"It is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

A more technical definition was formed by **Tom Mitchell**, who proposed in 1998 that a machine learning algorithm:

"Is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
